# Summative showcase - Amisha Portfolio (15 July 2025)
**Chosen theme and purpose:**
- I created a portfolio website for myself as a UX designer and design system specialist. I chose to create a simple website that highlights my key specialities, lists some of my past projects, and includes some information about myself and my work history.
- I decided to go for a black and white theme to create a dramatic or edgy feeling, with some doodles here and there to highlight the creativity of my role.

**The structure of my site:**
amisha-portfolio/
├── index.html
├── about.html
├── projects.html
├── /css/styes.css
└── /js/script.js
└── /assets/ [All svgs, png and jpeg assets are here]
├── readme.md


**Any challenges faced and how I solved them:**
- Something I struggled with was padding, margins, and gaps. Even though I was specifying specific amounts, it seemed larger than expected. Some suggestions mentioned applying box-sizing: border-box to the entire CSS file, which I did, but it does not seem to have worked.
  
**How I applied accessibility and semantic HTML best practices**
- In terms of colour, I made sure to use colours that pass AA contrast ratios according to WCAG.
- I also used semantic HTML where possible, such as header, main, h1, h2, h3, h4, p, etc.
- I applied alt text for images or icon buttons that were necessary to be read out. Where it was not necessary, the alt="" was left blank because the images were purely decorative.
- SSomething that also improves accessibility is catering for responsive design. At screen sizes smaller than 768px, the layout adapts so that layout and text are more legible on smaller devices by improving how elements stack.
