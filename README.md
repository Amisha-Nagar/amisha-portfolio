# Summative showcase - Amisha Portfolio (15 July 2025)
**Chosen theme and purpose:**
- I created a portfolio website for me as a UX designer and design system specialist. I chose to create a simple website that highlights my key specialities, lists some of my past projects and has some info about myself and my work history.
- I decided to go for a black and white theme to create an dramatic or edgy feeling, with some doodles here and there to highlight creativity of my role

**The structure of my site:**


**Any challenges faced and how I solved them:**

  
**How I applied accessibility and semantic HTML best practices**
- In terms of colour, I made sure to use colours that pass AA constrast ratios according to WCAG
- I also used semantic HTML where possible, like header, main, h1, h2, h3, h4, p, and using alt for images or icon buttons that were necessary to be read out
